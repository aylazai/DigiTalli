This project is designed to count the number of people entering and exiting a space to ensure that facilities do not exceed their maximum capacity and follow COVID-19 protocols. The system is built using an Arduino microcontroller and two ultrasonic sensors.

In addition to counting people, the system also includes a non-contact infrared thermometer that checks temperature as people walk in. If a person's temperature is above a certain threshold, an alert is triggered to notify staff.

When the maximum capacity is reached, the system uses a contactless method to collect phone numbers from people who wish to enter. The system will then send a notification to the user when they are able to enter, reducing the need for people to wait in line or crowd around the entrance.
